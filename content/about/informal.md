There are many times in our lives that we introduce ourselves to different people. Depending on the settings, introductions comes in different shapes and forms.

For example, there is a difference in formality; there is a difference in length; there is a difference in the medium used for delivering a self-introduction; there is a difference in goal; there is a difference in the audience (the numbers, their backgrounds/interests/purposes); there is a difference in whether it is scripted or not. It can be a description box with limited length for an account on social media, it can be a resume/CV, it can also be a preliminary part of some small talks in social gathering settings.

**All in all, no matter the settings, the content of an self-introduction is about "who am I", presented in a way that allows connections with others, or further opportunities to engage in subsequent interactions.**

My technical skills, expertise, and passion for what I do professionally is the majority of the contents on this site. The contents on other nerdy hobbies of mine might also be things that might entertain people on the Internet.

However, I would like to use the subsequent spaces to write about my past life, which would touch upon some lessons I've learned along the way, as well as touching upon some religious aspects. It is titled "informal", as it is not a common thing that people would brought up in a formal conversation with strangers, but at times I often find that personal stories as such a nice entry point for deeper connections and mutual understanding with others, when encountering new folks.
