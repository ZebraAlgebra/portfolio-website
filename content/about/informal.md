> <sup>11</sup> You make known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand. (Psalms 16:11; NIV)

> <sup>11</sup> 你必將生命的道路指示我，在你面前有滿足的喜樂，在你右手中有永遠的福樂。（詩篇 16:11，和合本）

As I was writing this page, I was constantly bothering myself with the following questions:

1. What was my goal?
2. Who were my audiences?
3. What would the content - a life of someone else - be of significance to some other person in the digital ocean named Internet?
