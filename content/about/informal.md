<sup>11</sup> You make known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.

## A Little Preface

There are many times in our lives that we tried introducing ourselves to different people. Depending on the settings, introductions comes in different shapes and forms.

For example, there is a difference in formality; there is a difference in length; there is a difference in the medium used for delivering a self-introduction; there is a difference in goal; there is a difference in the audience (the numbers, their backgrounds/interests/purposes); there is a difference in whether it is scripted or not. It can be a description box with limited length for an account on social media, it can be a resume/CV, it can also just be a preliminary part of small talks in a social gathering.

**All in all, no matter the settings, the content of an self-introduction is about "who am I", presented in a way that allows connections with others, or further opportunities to engage in subsequent interactions.**

My technical skills, expertise, and passion for what I do professionally is the majority of the contents on this site. The contents on other nerdy hobbies of mine might also be things that might entertain people on the Internet.

However, I would like to use the subsequent spaces to write about my _religion_, expressed through a reflection on my past life. It is titled "informal", as it is not something that people would immediately brought up in a formal conversation with strangers, but is something that was significant to me, and that I think would offer some perspectives that might inspire people.
