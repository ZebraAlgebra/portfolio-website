## A Little Name Game

{{< picture src="images/about/selfie.png" alt="Selfie" class="col-sm-8 col-md-6 col-lg-5 mb-4" >}}

Let us play a little name game.

1. My name is Samuel Wade Wang. In person, I look like the photo above (supposedly).
2. From the photo above, you might have figured out that I am an _Asian_. In fact, I have a Chinese name - written as ÁéãÂÅâ, which can be [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization) as _Wang, Wei_.
3. If you know some Chinese, you might notice that this name is written in [Traditional Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters) - if written in [Simplified Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters), this name should be written as Áéã‰ºü.
{{< details "Random Fact" >}}
 This name was once ranked #2 among the [most common names in mainland China](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hant/%E6%9C%80%E5%B8%B8%E8%A6%8B%E5%90%8D%E5%AD%97%E5%88%97%E8%A1%A8#%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%A4%A7%E9%99%86) (based on 2013 data; [things have changed since then](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_given_names#Male_names_3)).
{{< /details >}}
4. Based on this info, you might guess that I am from either Taiwan, Macao, or Hongkong, some of the major areas[^1] in the North East Asia that uses Tradititional Chinese as their official language.
5. From the romanization, you might further guess that I am from Taiwan, by the pronunciation. Truly, I grew up in Taiwan, now living in U.S.A. though.
6. By the fact that I have a two-syllable name instead of three, you might even guess that my family constitutes mainly of [Waishengren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waishengren). Yes, you are correct; and yes, we are proud in our [beef noodles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_noodle_soup#Taiwanese_beef_noodle_soup) skills and recipes.
{{< details "Details on Heritage" >}}
My maternal grandfather was of Shandong heritage, and my paternal grandfather was of Shanghai heritage.
{{< /details >}}
7. You might have suspected that the "Wade" in my English middle name is an indirect translation of my "Wei" in my Chinese name. That is in fact true!
9. I have a brother and a sister - their names are Daniel Jay Wang, and Stephanie Ann Wang. Following the similar naming scheme. Let's guess their Chinese names:
{{< details "Reveal Hint 1" >}}
Hint 1: They also have two syllable names
{{< /details >}}
{{< details "Reveal Hint 2" >}}
Hint 2: They are also common Chinese names, with famous people sharing the same name
{{< /details >}}
{{< details "Reveal Answer" >}}
Daniel Jay Wang: ÁéãÂÇë(Êù∞), Stephanie Ann Wang: ÁéãÂÆâ
{{< /details >}}
10. My brother (resp. sister) is older than me by 8 (resp. 10) years. From this age-gap info, you might infer that the "Samuel" in my English first name might arise from the fact that my mother gave birth to me at a relatively older age, which relates to some biblical stories of mothers giving birth at relatively later age[^2]. You might also figured out that I was raised in a Christian family. These are all true, and I would be genuinely surprised if you figured this out ü§Ø.

## Short Bio

My family moved back to Taiwan from U.S. before I was 1 year old. Afterwards, I grew up in Taiwan, went through education and mandatory millitary training, and came to the States after I completed my B.S. and M.S. degree in math[^3], pursuing a M.S. degree in Analytics and Georgia Institute of Technology from Aug. 2023, ultimately graduating in Dec. 2024.

I was once a math person, wanted to have a career in academia, doing algebraic geometry (mostly in moduli spaces). After years of self-isolation and struggle, my views and interests gradually changed, and I finally made up my mind to make the transition to applied math.

## My Goals

Currently I am in the process of job / internship search. After graduation, I realized that there are so many kinds of jobs in the "data field" - business intelligence, business analytics, data management, data analytics, data engineering, data scientist, machine learning engineer, statistical programmer, statistical analyst, research roles, ...  so I am continue learning new tools, relevant technologies, related theories during the mean time, as well as building projects demonstrating data-related skills.

The short-term goal is to obtain work experience, know as much thing in different areas of the data field, and get to a 

In some sense, I would envision an ideal life to be something like[^4]:

## My Interests

1. **Anime**. The [CGDCT](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteGirlsDoingCuteThings), [SOL](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SliceOfLife/AnimeAndManga), or [Iyashikei](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Iyashikei) genre are my cups of tea.
    - You can also find me on [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/profile/Cabbage_Cat).
    - Some of my favorites among these genres would be things like: K-on, Bocchi the Rock, Aria, Mitsuboshi Colors, Ichigo Mashimaro, Gal to Kyouryuu, Azumanga Daioh, Joshiraku, Kitaku-bu Katsudou Kiroku, Yuru Yuri, Nichijou.
    - Some more "serious" ones would include Yagate Kimi ni Naru, Sakurada Reset, Haibane Renmei, Mawaru Penguindrum, Dungeon Meshi.
2. **Music**.
    - I listen to anime bgms, op/ed, and used to make some 8bit covers of it using [FamiTracker](http://famitracker.com/) - it's a hobby that I no longer have much time doing it though, although I might pick it up again in the future.
    - When I drive, I mostly listen to worship songs (a lot of them being songs by [New Heart Ministries](https://www.newheartmusic.org/main)) for road-rage prevention.
    - I used to spent a lot of time listening progressive metal, jazz (mostly Bill Evans, Red Garland, McCoy Tyner, Art Tatum, Oscar Peterson, Bud Powell), as well as psychedelic rock.
3. **Tech**. I am interested in Linux - currently daily driving with [EndeavorOS](https://endeavouros.com/) - as well as frontend development using React. I am also interested in maths related to machine learning / optimization, and typesetting things with {{< math >}}$\LaTeX${{< /math >}}, refactoring proofs are also some nerdy hobbies of mine.

## My Belief

I grew up in a Christian family, but went through years of wandering and searching for meaning, as well as going through stages of existential-crisis.

It is through the help and guidance of other good brothers and sisters, as well as events that reshaped my view of life, I finally went back to the realization that nothing - including career, interests, relationships - surpasses the importance of a meaningful relationship with God and knowledge in Him, and such is the true root of joy and sense of fullfillment.

To end this informal introduction, I would like to share a Scripture that resonated within me recently as I reflected upon my past life:

{{<callout context="caution" title="Psalms 16:11; NIV + CUVMPT" icon="outline/bible" >}}
<sup>11</sup> You make known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.

<sup>11</sup> ‰Ω†ÂøÖÂ∞áÁîüÂëΩÁöÑÈÅìË∑ØÊåáÁ§∫ÊàëÔºåÂú®‰Ω†Èù¢ÂâçÊúâÊªøË∂≥ÁöÑÂñúÊ®ÇÔºåÂú®‰Ω†Âè≥Êâã‰∏≠ÊúâÊ∞∏ÈÅ†ÁöÑÁ¶èÊ®Ç„ÄÇ

[^1]: Congratulations! You just encountered a sensitive topic! Whether Taiwan is by definition a country or not is in some cases an argument-inducing topic (especially among our Mandarin-speaking folks), which is something I would avoid talking about in formal or professional settings; However, I feel like in most cases, this is a fun topic to joke around about. In case you are interested, my attitude towards this cute issue is best summarized by this [insightful website](https://www.omfgdogs.com).
[^2]: So my name could have been Isaac? I guess there was also consideration on the original meaning of the names from the Hebrews when the choice was made.
[^3]: A detailed version of my math journey is given in my [blog post](/blog/my-math-journey) in case you are interested why I made this career change, or in case you are just interested in what a nerdy math people's life might look like.
