Under the convention that every first thing starts with **hello**, the name of this post is self-explanatory ðŸ˜Š.

## Why a personal website?

To have things to put on LinkedIn, as a way to jot down some thoughts and discoveries, as an alternative way for writing down some optimization-related math notes, and most importantly - it is an interesting thing to do.

## How is this site generated?

#### The Short answer

This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), with theme [Doks](https://getdoks.org/), built on top of [Thulite](https://thulite.io/), hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

#### The Not-so-short answer

- This static site is built using the static site generator (SSG) [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which is Go-based. SSG is a convenient tool for generating nice webpages from Markdown files supplied by the user.
- The theme used in this site (which can be roughly understood as a set of pre-built configurations and clever customizations) is called [Doks](https://getdoks.org/).
- Doks is also built on top of the web framework [Thulite](https://thulite.io/), powered by Hugo and npm.
- This site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which provides services for hosting sites; for small sites, no fee is needed.

#### How to setup a Hugo Site?

1. Install [Go](https://go.dev/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
2. Browse the [themes gallery](https://themes.gohugo.io/), find one that you like the most and clone that into your machine.
3. Add contents and customize!

**That's basically it!**
