&lt;li>My name is Samuel Wade Wang. In person, I look like the photo above (supposedly).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From the photo above, you might have figured out that I am an &lt;em>Asian&lt;/em>. In fact, I have a Chinese name - written as 王偉, which can be &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization">romanized&lt;/a> as &lt;em>Wang, Wei&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you know some Chinese, you might notice that this name is written in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters">Traditional Chinese&lt;/a> - if written in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters">Simplified Chinese&lt;/a>, this name should be written as 王伟.
&lt;details>
 &lt;summary>Random Fact&lt;/summary>
 This name was once ranked #2 among the &lt;a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hant/%E6%9C%80%E5%B8%B8%E8%A6%8B%E5%90%8D%E5%AD%97%E5%88%97%E8%A1%A8#%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%A4%A7%E9%99%86">most common names in mainland China&lt;/a> (based on 2013 data; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_given_names#Male_names_3">things have changed since then&lt;/a>).&lt;/details>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Based on this info, you might guess that I am from either Taiwan, Macao, or Hongkong, some of the major areas&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> in the North East Asia that uses Tradititional Chinese as their official language.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From the romanization, you might further guess that I am from Taiwan, by the pronunciation. Truly, I grew up in Taiwan, now living in U.S.A. though.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By the fact that I have a two-syllable name instead of three, you might even guess that my family constitutes mainly of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waishengren">Waishengren&lt;/a>. Yes, you are correct; and yes, we are proud in our &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_noodle_soup#Taiwanese_beef_noodle_soup">beef noodles&lt;/a> skills and recipes.
&lt;details>
 &lt;summary>Details on Heritage&lt;/summary>
 My maternal grandfather was of Shandong heritage, and my paternal grandfather was of Shanghai heritage.&lt;/details>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You might have suspected that the &amp;ldquo;Wade&amp;rdquo; in my English middle name is an indirect translation of my &amp;ldquo;Wei&amp;rdquo; in my Chinese name. That is in fact true.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I have a brother and a sister - their names are Daniel Jay Wang, and Stephanie Ann Wang. Following the similar naming scheme. Let&amp;rsquo;s guess their Chinese names:
&lt;details>
 &lt;summary>Reveal Hint 1&lt;/summary>
 Hint 1: They also have two syllable names&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
 &lt;summary>Reveal Hint 2&lt;/summary>
 Hint 2: They are also common Chinese names, with famous people sharing the same name&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
 &lt;summary>Reveal Answer&lt;/summary>
 Daniel Jay Wang: 王傑(杰), Stephanie Ann Wang: 王安&lt;/details>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>My brother (resp. sister) is older than me by 8 (resp. 10) years. From this age-gap info, you might infer that the &amp;ldquo;Samuel&amp;rdquo; in my English first name might arise from the fact that my mother gave birth to me at a relatively older age, which is based on some biblical stories of mothers giving birth at relatively later age&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and that we are Christian family. I would be genuinely surprised if you figured this out.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="short-bio">Short Bio&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My family moved back to Taiwan from U.S. before I was 1 year old. Afterwards, I grew up in Taiwan, went through education and mandatory millitary training, and came to the States after I completed my B.S. and M.S. degree in math&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, pursuing a M.S. degree in Analytics and Georgia Institute of Technology from Aug. 2023, ultimately graduating in Dec. 2024.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
