In person, I look like the photo above (supposedly). From the photo above, you might have figured out that I am an Asian. In fact, I have a Chinese name - written as 王偉, which can be romanized as Wang, Wei. If you know some Chinese, you might notice that this name is written in Traditional Chinese - if written in Simplified Chinese, this name should be written as 王伟. Random FactThis name was once ranked #2 among the most common names in mainland China (based on 2013 data; things have changed since then). Based on this info, you might guess that I am from either Taiwan, Macao, or Hongkong, some of the major areas1 in the North East Asia that uses Tradititional Chinese as their official language. From the romanization, you might further guess that I am from Taiwan, by the pronunciation. Truly, I grew up in Taiwan, now living in U.S.A. though. By the fact that I have a two-syllable name instead of three, you might even guess that my family constitutes mainly of Waishengren. Yes, you are correct; and yes, we are proud in our beef noodles skills and recipes. Details on HeritageMy maternal grandfather was of Shandong heritage, and my paternal grandfather was of Shanghai heritage. You might have suspected that the “Wade” in my English middle name is an indirect translation of my “Wei” in my Chinese name. That is in fact true. I have a brother and a sister - their names are Daniel Jay Wang, and Stephanie Ann Wang. Following the similar naming scheme. Let’s guess their Chinese names: Reveal Hint 1Hint 1: They also have two syllable names Reveal Hint 2Hint 2: They are also common Chinese names, with famous people sharing the same name Reveal AnswerDaniel Jay Wang: 王傑(杰), Stephanie Ann Wang: 王安 My brother (resp. sister) is older than me by 8 (resp. 10) years. From this age-gap info, you might infer that the “Samuel” in my English first name might arise from the fact that my mother gave birth to me at a relatively older age, which is based on some biblical stories of mothers giving birth at relatively later age2, and that we are Christian family. I would be genuinely surprised if you figured this out. Short Bio My family moved back to Taiwan from U.S. before I was 1 year old. Afterwards, I grew up in Taiwan, went through education and mandatory millitary training, and came to the States after I completed my B.S. and M.S. degree in math3, pursuing a M.S. degree in Analytics and Georgia Institute of Technology from Aug. 2023, ultimately graduating in Dec. 2024."><meta property="og:locale" content="en"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="about"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2024-11-20T19:56:15-05:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2024-11-20T19:56:15-05:00"><meta property="og:image" content="/cover.png"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary_large_image"><meta name=twitter:image content="/cover.png"><meta name=twitter:title content="Informal Self-Introduction"><meta name=twitter:description content="A Little Name Game My name is Samuel Wade Wang.
