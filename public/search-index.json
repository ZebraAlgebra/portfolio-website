Computing for Data Analysis iCDA CSE6040\nDEW: 3/9/5 Format: HW: Weekly basis. All Jupyter notebooks. Exams: 3 exams. Open book, but no Github Copilot, posting exam questions on forums, or interacting with other people. Similar to homeworks and practice problems. Projects: One optional project. I didn\u0026rsquo;t do it and it became a regret of mine. Content: Basics of data wrangling and numerical computation in Python (data structures, Numpy, Scipy sparse matrices, Pandas) Basics of SQL (SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, GROUPBY\u0026hellip; clauses). Several basic demos of ML algorithms (regression, K-means, PCA). Tips: Do HW as soon as possible. More difficult to complete hw under time pressure for coding HWs. Do practice questions before exam. 2. Introduction to Analytics Modeling iAM ISYE6501\nDEW: 5/8/6 Format: HW: Weekly basis. All R markdowns, with a few exceptions: For linear programming, Python\u0026rsquo;s PuLP is needed. For discrete event simulation, either Arena or Python\u0026rsquo;s SimPy are needed. Exams: 3 exams. Project: 1 project, details released near the end of semester. Content: Learning how to use some ML models in R on data, assess model quality, as well as teaching some basic data science ideas. Tips: Get used to R and R markdown notebooks, as well as figuring out a suitable workflow, since students have to generate a report file every week. 3. Simulation Sim ISYE6644\nDEW: 4/8/4 Format: HW: Weekly basis. Multiple choice questions on Canvas. Exams: 3 exams. Allows cheat sheets. Project: 1 project. One can either work on topics supplied by the teaching team, or come up with one. Content: Probabilities, statistics bootcamps. The Arena software, Theories for simulating random number generators and stochastic processes. Tips: Read Prof. Goldsman\u0026rsquo;s book on probabilities and stats. The tip for having a good score on exams is to compile good cheat sheets. Misc.: Prof. Goldsman\u0026rsquo;s lecture videos has some funny jokes. 4. Business Fundamentals in Analytics BFA MGT8803\nDEW: 9/4/3 Format: HW: 2 small ones that accounts for 10% of total grade. Exams: 5 exams for each 5 modules (see below). Allows the use of excel. No cheat sheets. Project: None. Content: 5 modules Financial Accounting Finance Supply Chain Business Strategy Marketing Tips: The first two modules are extremely packed with info. For people without background related to these fields, all the concepts in these modules can take a fiar while to be digested. Tips for studying for the first two exams Do the self assessment questions repeatedly Get used to the Excel workflow for doing the accounting, finance calculations Check for study cards online, some OMSA alumnis prepared them, e.g. this one on quizlet. Misc.: As mentioned above, the first two modules are no-joke - I pulled three all-nighters at the library just to study for these 2 exams. Many people in the OMSA slack channel recommended taking this class during the summer, as one can drop one modules for the final grade calculations. 5. Computational Data Analytics CDA ISYE6740\nDEW: 7/9/7 Format: This course is basically Machine Learning I. It has mathy parts in it (writing proofs, do hand calculations, implement algorithms, report and explain findings). There are 6 homeworks and 1 final project, no exams. For the final project, our team also worked on a book recommendation system built upon the famous Bookcrossing dataset, using the traditional user-based collaborative filtering (UBCF). The bottleneck we encountered was that the user-item matrix was too large, so we experimented with different interesting approaches to tackle this problem. Misc.: I enjoyed this course a lot. Lectures are very helpful and clear, and the homeworks are fun to work with. 6. Data Analytics in Business DAB MGT6203\nDEW: 3/5/3 Format: HW: 3 homeworks in R-markdown format, graded by peer. Exams: 2 midterms, several self-assessments. Project: Team proejct. Our team did some analysis on the Kaggle data set UFC Dataset. Tips: Find teams early. The most time will be spent on projects. Misc.: The technical aspects of this course is covered by iAM, albeit even easier. 7. Data and Visual Analytics DVA CSE6242\nDEW: 5/6/9 Format: HW: 4 homeworks, graded by autograders. HW2 is a lot of d3.js. HW3 is to play with GCP, AWS, Databricks, Azure, \u0026hellip; HW4 builds a random forest. Exams: No exams. Project: We build a book recommender app; check out our Github repo. Tips: Study d3 soon. Learn how to make bar charts, line graphs, choropleth maps. Basic knowledge in DOM structure is beneficial and the autograder is very strict about it. Read through the project specifications carefully, don\u0026rsquo;t miss anything as gradings strictly follows it. E.g., all team members has to record an unlisted Youtube video explaining the poster representations, and I mistakenly assumed that only one video per team is required, so I lost 5 pts for it. Misc.: I personally think that the major takeaway of this course is the experience to collab with other students, as well as trying to pick up unknown technologies as fast as possible. Although the course touches upon several different technologies, most of the time time is spent on reading through long homework specifications and fighting against the autograder. 8. Higher Dimensional Data Analytics HDDA ISYE8803\nDEW: 7/10/7 Format: Content: Functional Data Analysis (spline, FPCA) Image Analysis Tensor Data Analysis (Tucker Decomposition, HOSVD) Optimization I (1st+2nd order methods) (Dropped in Summer) Optimization II (Proximal Gradient Descent, ALM+ADMM, Coordinate Descent) (Dropped in Summer) Regularization (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, NNG and Adaptive Lasso, Grouped Lasso) Applications of Regularization (Compressive Sensing, Matrix Completion, RPCA, SSD, RKHS Ridge Kernel Regression) HW and Exams: 2 Exams, 7 Homeworks corresponding to 7 modules (optimization modules dropped in summer). Exams are similar to HWs, but is fun and challenging. Misc.: I absolutely loved this course. Would recommend to anyone in the program that likes math. 9. Network Science NS CS7280\nDEW: 4/5/5 Format: Content: Network models, core network science notions, community detection, dynamic processes on networks. HW and Exams: 5 HWs (Jupyter notebooks with exercises using NetworkX and other related libraries), 14 Quizzes. Misc.: I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like I learned much from the course; concepts are pretty high-level without clear explanations. The textbook they used is the online textbook by Barabasi, but I would personally recommend anyone that is interested in network science to look into the book by Newman. 10. Applied Natural Language Processing ANLP CSE8803\nDEW: 3/6/4 Format: HW: 4 HWs (Jupyter Notebooks with exercises using packages that does text embeddings, or packages in PyTorch, HuggingFace that does NLP things). Quizzes for each module. Misc. The contents are cool, allowing us to toy with some cool NLP tools (such as LSTM, BERT). 11. Applied Analytics Practicum Prac CSE6748\nDEW: 5/8/7 Content: Form a team, and work on a project. Our project is sponsered by MedTransGo, where we analyzed their tech update text logs as well as their transaction records (both of which we transformed into time series), to do trend and seasonality detection, correlation analysis, and visualizations. Format: Deliverables includes Midterm Slidedecks and Final Reports. One also has to watch course videos, accounting for 20% of the grade. For the course videos, the check marks might not indicate a full completion score - jumping within videos will result in point deductions. Misc.: It was in this project that I discovered the crazy power of PowerBI, when I witnessed my teammate using it. 12.

We intended the user to interact with the app in the following ways:\nIn the first way, the users may enter a prompt, indicating their preferences, and our CBF backend API endpoint will search for top books that matches this response utilizing the bert-base-uncased model. In the second way, the users may have an anonymized view of other users, and if their is a match in preferences, our CF backend API endpoint will find the top books that the users might also like. We tried to look for existing implementations, such as the surprise library. However we found that some sparse implementations and fine-tweaks might be needed to fit our needs, so I decided to implment it myself. In both ways, the API endpoints are implemented in flask. In both ways, we visualize the books as force graphs, where each book is a node. The users can drag around, zoom in/out on the force graphs, and right click to expand a node\u0026rsquo;s most similar nodes. Here we implemented the UI and force graphs functionalities via material-ui, react-force-graph React libraries. To appear: System Design Diagram\nMy contributions My contributions are summarized in the following table:\nComponents Implementation Role Frontend - UI material-ui Main implementation Frontend - Visualization react-force-graph Main implementation Backend flask Exposed CF Functionality as an API endpoint Modeling - CF From scratch Implemented CF from scratch, and tested different similarity metrics via 9-fold CV Animated Screenshots The final app has the following look (animated GIF generated from our unlisted YouTube Video Demo, produced with CLI tools yt-dlp, ffmpeg, magick):\nIssues and Rooms for Improvements I thought the idea of project was pretty cool, but I will talk about some improvement directions and related takeaways on my side (some of which are things that I wished I had more time to spent working on on my part):\nDeployment Issues: We tried to find free solutions for deploying this webapp online, but the final webapp was pretty large, so we decided to keep it as an app that can be built locally. The main reason was that the backend functionality for CBF uses the entire bert-base-uncased model, which was about 0.5GB in size (without accounting for the size of other Python libraries needed). A possible direction for improvement is to use distilled version of it (either distilbert-base-uncased or TinyBERT_General_4L_312D).\nExploration Issues: The exploration ability of the force graph is actually pretty limited - each time we generate top 5 recommendations, but we often ended up in a complete graph, and each node expands to nodes that we have seen before, making the exploration process stagnant. We do not know if this is an issue in our modeling process (whether the CBF or the CF part), our data (where we have very strong nodes dominating the whole graph).\nUI/UX Issues: The view for existing users is extremely inconvenient - I implemented in a way that one can only click alone one direction to look at one book at a time. This is one part that I wanted to improve, but I was not very adept with the MUI library at that time.\nRWD Design: I didn\u0026rsquo;t have time finishing the webapp design for adaptability for devices of various size, which is a crucial aspect of modern webapp devlopment, although breakpoints for media queries were used.\nFinal Thoughts This is my first time trying to build an end-to-end pseudo-complete data product with a team. This might be a weird of saying this, but during my days in the OMSA program, I was always suprised when I see datas actually doing stuffs.\nBack to Projects Page\rBack to Resume\rAggarwal, Charu C.

A good reference would be the note by Sébastien Bubeck 1.\nI will first give a high-level breakdown on why this algorithm works, then briefly write about how mathematically the ellipsoids are manipulated. Another optimization algorithm that is seldomly used in practice, but conceptually closely-related is the center of gravity method. This is explored here.\n1. Setting the Stage 1.1. Assumptions and Notations Optimization Problem. Minimize a convex function defined over a convex body .\nGeneral results on convex analysis guarantees that attains minimum on some ; let us also write the optimal value as .\nAssumptions. For , we make the assumptions:\nValue Bound. for some . Volume Bound. for some , ; here is the open ball centered at with radius . Available Oracles. We assume the following 0th and 1st-order oracles available to us:\nSeparation Oracle. Given , we can ask for a direction with , where is the half space . Subgradient Oracle. Given , we can ask for a direction . 1.2. Utilizing Volume and Value Bounds via Shrinking Intuitively, points close to shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too bad. Although we do not know , it still makes sense to consider the following construction: Given , define the set (which can be thought of shrinking towards ):\nOn this set, we have the function bounds and volume bounds on :\nby utilizing our assumptions on convexity, volume and value bounds. In this sense, we have the following general idea:\nIf we are able to solve for an optimal point in a major portion of the feasibility region, this point would in fact be close to the true optimal solution.\nWe formalize this idea and give an abstract proof of why the ellipsoid method works.\n1.3. General Proof of Convergence The ellipsoid method is an iterative method. In each step, it gains total control of a part of the feasibility region, by using ellipsoids as a proxy, through halving along subgradients or separating hyperplanes.\nSuppose at time , the remaining uncontrolled region is written as . This gives us a descending sequence of subsets:\nAs an old adage goes:\nTo control an onion, all you have to do is to control its peels.\nwe mathematically express , where are the peels, and formulate strategies to control .\nNow for each set , say we have a point with either , or with , then by taking , and assuming , we in fact have . For a proof, note that for any , the volume bounds on shows that cannot contain for large enough , while we have:\nThe following diagram might be useful for navigating the definitions and symbols (coutesy to draw.io)\nIn optimization, we are also interested in the question of the speed of convergence. By using the same idea for estimation, we see that it depends on . In ellipsoid methods - as one can guess it - these are given by manipulations with ellipsoids; in center of gravity methods, these are given by other means.\n1.4. Using Ellipsoids and Subgradients It is now (finally 😅) the time to introduce the ellipsoid algorithm. The steps are as follows:\nInitiallize: Ellipsoid , , , Halving: If , call separation oracle for a nonzero direction , so that Else call subgradient oracle for a direction . If , optimality condition reached, terminate. Otherwise continue. Update: Update via the explicit formulas in the next section, to have the properties: and update: to be the new center of this ellipsoid. the argmin of if ; else set to . . . Note that the sets and points then satisfies the settings we previously introduced that will lead to convergence. With a bit of algebra, one has the following:\nEllipsoid Method: Feasibility and Convergence\nFor , we have , with:\nA bit of interpretation on this result, which would illustrate some cool characteristics of this algorithm:\nThe analytical complexity (that is, the number of calls to the oracles needed) to guarantee an accuracy to is , from a black-box optimization perspective. In such sense, it is a dimension-dependent algorithm - as dimension grows, the calls needed grows. As one can see later, the cost update are just some matrix-vector multiplications, as opposed to center-of-gravity which although have a better analytical complexity (of ), but each time step requires the computation of a nontrivial integral, in which in the most easy cases exact solvers still needs exponential computation time. 2. Ellipsoidal Shenanigans Now let us look at some technical tools and results that allow us to work with ellipsoids, tying together the lose ends introduced in the algorithm above.\nIt is just a brief note on how the math is done, leaving out much of the book-keeping and formula derivations. For even more casual readers, you have already understand what ellipsoid method does🎉!\n2.1. Representation of an Ellipsoid An ellipsoid is an affine image of . It can be represented as:\nwhere is SPD (symmetric positive definite) (assuming it having positive volume), admitting a decomposition ; such then describes as , hence an ellipsoid.\n2.2. \u0026ldquo;Ellipsoiding\u0026rdquo; Halved Ellipsoids Here is a fun problem in geometry:\nQuestion\nGiven an ellipsoid with positive volume , a direction , how small an ellipsoid (in terms of volume) can we find so that it encloses the halved ellipsoid ?\nThe case is trivial, so we assume .\nIt would be illustrative to work out the case where , and , then map it back using . We want and lie in , so we define:\nwith ; note that , for . By this requirement, we formulate the optimization problem:\nAfter expressing via , we have by calculus that the optimal point is with value:\nAfter taking account the rescaling of and the remapping of points , we get:\nEllipsoid Update Formula\nFor , we get:\nwhere:\rBubeck, Sébastien. \u0026ldquo;Convex optimization: Algorithms and complexity.\u0026rdquo; Foundations and Trends® in Machine Learning 8.3-4 (2015): 231-357.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"2024-11-21","id":8,"permalink":"/math_notes/cvx_optimization/ellipse/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn this article, I will give a brief guide on what the \u003cem\u003eellipsoid method\u003c/em\u003e is.

Setting the Stage 1.1. First Comparison with the Ellipsoid Algorithm A high level description of the ellipsoid algorithm is that total control of a part of the feasibility region - the \u0026ldquo;onion peels\u0026rdquo; - are gained within each iteration via slicing along suitable directions (either it being a direction for a separating hyperplanes, or a direction given by subgradients), and by volume and shrinking arguments, as the uncontrolled feasibility region shrinks, the optimal value on regions on the peels, would not be too far from that from the uncontrolled region.\nThe \u0026ldquo;ellipsoidal\u0026rdquo; parts comes in the part where we want to gain control to a next peel, which uses ellipsoids as proxies.

The Algorithm Let us use again to denote the \u0026ldquo;peel\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;remaining onion\u0026rdquo; at time .\nInitiallize: , , to be any point in .\nHalving:\nCall COG oracle (here we think of it as a zeroth order oracle) to obtain the COG: Call subgradient oracle obtain . If , optimality condition reached, terminate. Otherwise continue.\nUpdate:\n; which has the property: the argmin of . One has the following:\nCOG Method: Convergence\nWe have the following bound:\nSome remarks:\nThe step \u0026ldquo;Compute center of gravity\u0026rdquo; is a highly nontrivial step in general if one wants exact solutions (e.g., think of the problem of computing the COG of a simplex with vertices). In such sense, this algorithm is more of theoretical importance then of practical use. The volume inequality during the passage from to will be shown below - it is related to the so-called Grünbaum Inequality, which can be proved by also another famous inequality called Brunn-Minkowski Ineuqality. The analytical complexity to guarantee an accuracy of is . Compared to ellipsoid method\u0026rsquo;s , both having linear rate of convergence, it is less sensitive to the underlying dimension . 2. Math of COG The heart of the COG method lies within Brunn-Minkowski\u0026rsquo;s inequality and Grünbaum\u0026rsquo;s inequality. The latter inequality ensures that the peel we gain control of in each step of the COG method is large enough, while the first is an inequality relating two convex sets with their convex combination.\nWe introduce the following notations:\nGiven and , we write: which is just a dirty notation for constructing cones, convex combinations. Some times we do not distinguish between elements and one-point sets. We write , the volume of the unit ball (in ) Given a measurable subset , we write , which satisfies: Given with , we define as the set where is the set of elements that has inner product with a value .

Depending on the settings, introductions comes in different shapes and forms.\nFor example, there is a difference in formality; there is a difference in length; there is a difference in the medium used for delivering a self-introduction; there is a difference in goal; there is a difference in the audience (the numbers, their backgrounds/interests/purposes); there is a difference in whether it is scripted or not. It can be a description box with limited length for an account on social media, it can be a resume/CV, it can also be a preliminary part of some small talks in social gathering settings.\nAll in all, no matter the settings, the content of an self-introduction is about \u0026ldquo;who am I\u0026rdquo;, presented in a way that allows connections with others, or further opportunities to engage in subsequent interactions.\nMy technical skills, expertise, and passion for what I do professionally is the majority of the contents on this site. The contents on other nerdy hobbies of mine might also be things that might entertain people on the Internet.\nHowever, I would like to use the subsequent spaces to write about my past life, which would touch upon some lessons I\u0026rsquo;ve learned along the way, as well as touching upon some religious aspects. It is titled \u0026ldquo;informal\u0026rdquo;, as it is not a common thing that people would brought up in a formal conversation with strangers, but at times I often find that personal stories as such a nice entry point for deeper connections and mutual understanding with others, when encountering new folks.\n","date":"2024-11-20","id":10,"permalink":"/about/informal/","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"callout callout-caution d-flex flex-row mt-4 mb-4 pt-4 pe-4 pb-2 ps-3\"\u003e\r\n  \u003csvg\n  xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n  width=\"24\"\n  height=\"24\"\n  viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n  fill=\"none\"\n  stroke=\"currentColor\"\n  stroke-width=\"2\"\n  stroke-linecap=\"round\"\n  stroke-linejoin=\"round\"\n \n class=\"outline/bible svg-inline callout-icon me-2 mb-3\" id=\"svg-bible\" role=\"img\"\u003e\n  \u003cpath stroke=\"none\" d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"none\"/\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M19 4v16h-12a2 2 0 0 1 -2 -2v-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 -2h12z\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M19 16h-12a2 2 0 0 0 -2 2\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M12 7v6\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M10 9h4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/svg\u003e\r\n  \u003cdiv class=\"callout-content\"\u003e\r\n    \u003cdiv class=\"callout-title\"\u003e\r\n        \u003cp\u003ePsalms 16:11; NIV + CUVMPT\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"Informal Self-Introduction"},{"content":"These are some of my convex optimization notes, written in the form of Hugo pages.\n","date":"2023-09-07","id":11,"permalink":"/math_notes/cvx_optimization/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThese are some of my convex optimization notes, written in the form of Hugo pages.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"Convex Optimization Notes"},{"content":"","date":"2023-09-07","id":12,"permalink":"/docs_/guides/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Guides"},{"content":"Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
