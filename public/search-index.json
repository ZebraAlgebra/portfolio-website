Computing for Data Analysis iCDA CSE6040\nDEW: 3/9/5 Format: HW: Weekly basis. All Jupyter notebooks. Exams: 3 exams. Open book, but no Github Copilot, posting exam questions on forums, or interacting with other people. Similar to homeworks and practice problems. Projects: One optional project. I didn\u0026rsquo;t do it and it became a regret of mine. Content: Basics of data wrangling and numerical computation in Python (data structures, Numpy, Scipy sparse matrices, Pandas) Basics of SQL (SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, GROUPBY\u0026hellip; clauses). Several basic demos of ML algorithms (regression, K-means, PCA). Tips: Do HW as soon as possible. More difficult to complete hw under time pressure for coding HWs. Do practice questions before exam. 2. Introduction to Analytics Modeling iAM ISYE6501\nDEW: 5/8/6 Format: HW: Weekly basis. All R markdowns, with a few exceptions: For linear programming, Python\u0026rsquo;s PuLP is needed. For discrete event simulation, either Arena or Python\u0026rsquo;s SimPy are needed. Exams: 3 exams. Project: 1 project, details released near the end of semester. Content: Learning how to use some ML models in R on data, assess model quality, as well as teaching some basic data science ideas. Tips: Get used to R and R markdown notebooks, as well as figuring out a suitable workflow, since students have to generate a report file every week. 3. Simulation Sim ISYE6644\nDEW: 4/8/4 Format: HW: Weekly basis. Multiple choice questions on Canvas. Exams: 3 exams. Allows cheat sheets. Project: 1 project. One can either work on topics supplied by the teaching team, or come up with one. Content: Probabilities, statistics bootcamps. The Arena software, Theories for simulating random number generators and stochastic processes. Tips: Read Prof. Goldsman\u0026rsquo;s book on probabilities and stats. The tip for having a good score on exams is to compile good cheat sheets. Misc.: Prof. Goldsman\u0026rsquo;s lecture videos has some funny jokes. 4. Business Fundamentals in Analytics BFA MGT8803\nDEW: 9/4/3 Format: HW: 2 small ones that accounts for 10% of total grade. Exams: 5 exams for each 5 modules (see below). Allows the use of excel. No cheat sheets. Project: None. Content: 5 modules Financial Accounting Finance Supply Chain Business Strategy Marketing Tips: The first two modules are extremely packed with info. For people without background related to these fields, all the concepts in these modules can take a fiar while to be digested. Tips for studying for the first two exams Do the self assessment questions repeatedly Get used to the Excel workflow for doing the accounting, finance calculations Check for study cards online, some OMSA alumnis prepared them, e.g. this one on quizlet. Misc.: As mentioned above, the first two modules are no-joke - I pulled three all-nighters at the library just to study for these 2 exams. Many people in the OMSA slack channel recommended taking this class during the summer, as one can drop one modules for the final grade calculations. 5. Computational Data Analytics CDA ISYE6740\nDEW: 7/9/7 Format: This course is basically Machine Learning I. It has mathy parts in it (writing proofs, do hand calculations, implement algorithms, report and explain findings). There are 6 homeworks and 1 final project, no exams. For the final project, our team also worked on a book recommendation system built upon the famous Bookcrossing dataset, using the traditional user-based collaborative filtering (UBCF). The bottleneck we encountered was that the user-item matrix was too large, so we experimented with different interesting approaches to tackle this problem. Misc.: I enjoyed this course a lot. Lectures are very helpful and clear, and the homeworks are fun to work with. 6. Data Analytics in Business DAB MGT6203\nDEW: 3/5/3 Format: HW: 3 homeworks in R-markdown format, graded by peer. Exams: 2 midterms, several self-assessments. Project: Team proejct. Our team did some analysis on the Kaggle data set UFC Dataset. Tips: Find teams early. The most time will be spent on projects. Misc.: The technical aspects of this course is covered by iAM, albeit even easier. 7. Data and Visual Analytics DVA CSE6242\nDEW: 5/6/9 Format: HW: 4 homeworks, graded by autograders. HW2 is a lot of d3.js. HW3 is to play with GCP, AWS, Databricks, Azure, \u0026hellip; HW4 builds a random forest. Exams: No exams. Project: We build a book recommender app; check out our Github repo. Tips: Study d3 soon. Learn how to make bar charts, line graphs, choropleth maps. Basic knowledge in DOM structure is beneficial and the autograder is very strict about it. Read through the project specifications carefully, don\u0026rsquo;t miss anything as gradings strictly follows it. E.g., all team members has to record an unlisted Youtube video explaining the poster representations, and I mistakenly assumed that only one video per team is required, so I lost 5 pts for it. Misc.: I personally think that the major takeaway of this course is the experience to collab with other students, as well as trying to pick up unknown technologies as fast as possible. Although the course touches upon several different technologies, most of the time time is spent on reading through long homework specifications and fighting against the autograder. 8. Higher Dimensional Data Analytics HDDA ISYE8803\nDEW: 7/10/7 Format: Content: Functional Data Analysis (spline, FPCA) Image Analysis Tensor Data Analysis (Tucker Decomposition, HOSVD) Optimization I (1st+2nd order methods) (Dropped in Summer) Optimization II (Proximal Gradient Descent, ALM+ADMM, Coordinate Descent) (Dropped in Summer) Regularization (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, NNG and Adaptive Lasso, Grouped Lasso) Applications of Regularization (Compressive Sensing, Matrix Completion, RPCA, SSD, RKHS Ridge Kernel Regression) HW and Exams: 2 Exams, 7 Homeworks corresponding to 7 modules (optimization modules dropped in summer). Exams are similar to HWs, but is fun and challenging. Misc.: I absolutely loved this course. Would recommend to anyone in the program that likes math. 9. Network Science NS CS7280\nDEW: 4/5/5 Format: Content: Network models, core network science notions, community detection, dynamic processes on networks. HW and Exams: 5 HWs (Jupyter notebooks with exercises using NetworkX and other related libraries), 14 Quizzes. Misc.: I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like I learned much from the course; concepts are pretty high-level without clear explanations. The textbook they used is the online textbook by Barabasi, but I would personally recommend anyone that is interested in network science to look into the book by Newman. 10. Applied Natural Language Processing ANLP CSE8803\nDEW: 3/6/4 Format: HW: 4 HWs (Jupyter Notebooks with exercises using packages that does text embeddings, or packages in PyTorch, HuggingFace that does NLP things). Quizzes for each module. Misc. The contents are cool, allowing us to toy with some cool NLP tools (such as LSTM, BERT). 11. Applied Analytics Practicum Prac CSE6748\nDEW: 5/8/7 Content: Form a team, and work on a project. Our project is sponsered by MedTransGo, where we analyzed their tech update text logs as well as their transaction records (both of which we transformed into time series), to do trend and seasonality detection, correlation analysis, and visualizations. Format: Deliverables includes Midterm Slidedecks and Final Reports. One also has to watch course videos, accounting for 20% of the grade. For the course videos, the check marks might not indicate a full completion score - jumping within videos will result in point deductions. Misc.: It was in this project that I discovered the crazy power of PowerBI, when I witnessed my teammate using it. 12. Deterministic Optimization In progress.\n13. Deep Learning In progress.\n","date":"2024-11-29","id":0,"permalink":"/blog/omsa-course-review/","summary":"Review of courses in OMSA.","tags":["review"],"title":"OMSA Course Review"},{"content":"In this blog post, I will write about my past life as a math student, and how my perspective changed about pure math throughout these years.\nI hope that through my experience and some of the general lessons I learned, this article could serve as a source of inspiration or ideas for people that are walking along a similar career path as me.\nWork In Progress\n1. The Start of a Mathematical Journey I was fortunate enough to encounter many good teachers when growing up, enabling me to discover to joy of math. In my younger days - probably before high school, I enjoyed math, for the satisfication and self-confidence gained from problem solving. Starting from high school, through self-studying, I found the beauty of abstract mathematical theories.\nIt is hard to concisely describe the beauty of math in a few words, but roughly speaking, it is a mixture of:\nThe intellectual joy of exploring something that is both science and philosophy - understanding the inner workings of the world through the elegance of logic and the rigor of proofs. The inherent beauty of its abstract nature - its self-contained world of concepts that can exist independently of physical reality yet still profoundly shape our understanding of the world. The thrill of discovery - the unexpected surprises and patterns that emerge from frameworks built upon abstract symbols, blending both intuitive and novel ideas, as well as moments where we see seemingly unrelated theories intersect with each other. Its profound usefulness - as the universal language of science and technology, it provides tools to model and solve real-world problems. The learning experience - I have found that many texts are written so well and beautifully that left me in awe1, and continued to experience the joy of problem-solving through working out exercises, that are both challenging and rewarding. From this list, I hope that you have been convinced that I am fervent lover of math. I wanted to do math as a living before entering college, but I had concerns -\nI always felt like in order to be a good mathematician, both effort and talent are the most crucial factors - I do not think I have what it takes to become one, as I am not a math olympiad person, nor someone that had obtained success in individual research in my highschool days. I was ignorant about the job market for math graduates and was way too narrow-minded - I though it was either staying in the academia, or unhappily waiting my life to end in a place that doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any expertise in \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; abstract math (such as being a high school or cram school math teacher). I also had the impression that becoming a professor at National Taiwan University (my alma mater) is going to be extremely difficult, as a lot of the professors at that time did their PhDs in highly extinguished universities in the states. I thought being an engineering student with abstract math skills can be a plus. I recognized that I still know nearly nothing about what a math researcher\u0026rsquo;s life was. I ended up making the best use of my college entrance exams scores, and enrolled in NTU as a student majoring in mechanical engineering. However, I discovered that I still have a thirst for math in my first semester:\nI found myself spending a lot of my free time in the math department\u0026rsquo;s library, reading books and exploring topics in maths such as general / algebraic topology, category theory, linear/ abstract / commutative / homological algebra. While I can appreciate the practical aspects of the fundamental classes taught in the mechanical engineering department, I feel like at that time, something was missing - the theoretical aspects of things. For example, in Calculus, while memorizing ways to solve integrals or derivatives were fun, I wanted more proofs and systematic theories. After this realization, I started taking classes in the math department in the next semester, and successfully transfered at the start of my sophomore year. It was one of my happiest moments in my life, as the transfer process wasn\u0026rsquo;t easy (at least in NTU), so at that time, I made up my mind to completely isolate myself in the world of math, disengaging in any meaningless social interactions, and dedicate every time and energy to learning math, to get exceptional in at least one subfield.\n2. A Loner\u0026rsquo;s Struggle To name a few of my lifetime favorite classic math textbook authors: John Milnor, Jean-Pierre Serre, Walter Rudin, Tom M. Apostol, Hideyuki Matsumura, Michael Atiyah, William Fulton, Peter May, Robin Hartshorne, Tom Leinster, James Humphreys.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"2024-12-18","id":1,"permalink":"/blog/my-math-journey/","summary":"Blog post on my math journey.","tags":["life"],"title":"My Math Journey"},{"content":"\u0026#x1f44b; Hi there.

We intended the user to interact with the app in the following ways:\nIn the first way, the users may enter a prompt, indicating their preferences, and our CBF backend API endpoint will search for top books that matches this response utilizing the bert-base-uncased model. In the second way, the users may have an anonymized view of other users, and if their is a match in preferences, our CF backend API endpoint will find the top books that the users might also like. We tried to look for existing implementations, such as the surprise library. However we found that some sparse implementations and fine-tweaks might be needed to fit our needs, so I decided to implment it myself. In both ways, the API endpoints are implemented in flask. In both ways, we visualize the books as force graphs, where each book is a node. The users can drag around, zoom in/out on the force graphs, and right click to expand a node\u0026rsquo;s most similar nodes. Here we implemented the UI and force graphs functionalities via material-ui, react-force-graph React libraries. To appear: System Design Diagram\nMy contributions My contributions are summarized in the following table:\nComponents Implementation Role Frontend - UI material-ui Main implementation Frontend - Visualization react-force-graph Main implementation Backend flask Exposed CF Functionality as an API endpoint Modeling - CF From scratch Implemented CF from scratch, and tested different similarity metrics via 9-fold CV Animated Screenshots The final app has the following look (animated GIF generated from our unlisted YouTube Video Demo, produced with CLI tools yt-dlp, ffmpeg, magick):\nIssues and Rooms for Improvements I thought the idea of project was pretty cool, but I will talk about some improvement directions and related takeaways on my side (some of which are things that I wished I had more time to spent working on on my part):\nDeployment Issues: We tried to find free solutions for deploying this webapp online, but the final webapp was pretty large, so we decided to keep it as an app that can be built locally. The main reason was that the backend functionality for CBF uses the entire bert-base-uncased model, which was about 0.5GB in size (without accounting for the size of other Python libraries needed). A possible direction for improvement is to use distilled version of it (either distilbert-base-uncased or TinyBERT_General_4L_312D).\nExploration Issues: The exploration ability of the force graph is actually pretty limited - each time we generate top 5 recommendations, but we often ended up in a complete graph, and each node expands to nodes that we have seen before, making the exploration process stagnant. We do not know if this is an issue in our modeling process (whether the CBF or the CF part), our data (where we have very strong nodes dominating the whole graph).\nUI/UX Issues: The view for existing users is extremely inconvenient - I implemented in a way that one can only click alone one direction to look at one book at a time. This is one part that I wanted to improve, but I was not very adept with the MUI library at that time.\nRWD Design: I didn\u0026rsquo;t have time finishing the webapp design for adaptability for devices of various size, which is a crucial aspect of modern webapp development, although breakpoints for media queries were used.\nFinal Thoughts I learned a lot from this project:\nI used to have some \u0026ldquo;have watched some Udemy React course\u0026rdquo; React skill, and vague experience with other frontend development stuffs, but this project really pushed me to put these into works. This is my first time reading Flask backend codes, connecting frontend apps to it, as well as designing some additional endpoints. I used to have a vague idea on how maybe Python can be used to do such things, but working with teammates that have backend skills enabled me to see how this actually works. This is my first time learning about the BERT model. I made up my mind at that time to learn about this tool and possibly use it in the future when encountering analytics tasks involving NLP components. Most importantly, this is my first time trying to build an end-to-end pseudo-complete data product with a team. It might be a weird to say this, but I always find it exciting and happy to see when datas \u0026ldquo;doing things\u0026rdquo;.\nBack to Projects Page\rBack to Resume\rAggarwal, Charu C.

Minimize a convex function defined over a convex body .\nGeneral results on convex analysis guarantees that attains minimum on some ; let us also write the optimal value as .\nAssumptions. For , we make the assumptions:\nValue Bound. for some . Volume Bound. for some , ; here is the open ball centered at with radius . Available Oracles. We assume the following 0th and 1st-order oracles available to us:\nSeparation Oracle. Given , we can ask for a direction with , where is the half space . Subgradient Oracle. Given , we can ask for a direction . 1.2. Utilizing Volume and Value Bounds via Shrinking Intuitively, points close to shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too bad. Although we do not know , it still makes sense to consider the following construction: Given , define the set (which can be thought of shrinking towards ):\nOn this set, we have the function bounds and volume bounds on :\nby utilizing our assumptions on convexity, volume and value bounds. In this sense, we have the following general idea:\nIf we are able to solve for an optimal point in a major portion of the feasibility region, this point would in fact be close to the true optimal solution.\nWe formalize this idea and give an abstract proof of why the ellipsoid method works.\n1.3. General Proof of Convergence The ellipsoid method is an iterative method. In each step, it gains total control of a part of the feasibility region, by using ellipsoids as a proxy, through halving along subgradients or separating hyperplanes.\nSuppose at time , the remaining uncontrolled region is written as . This gives us a descending sequence of subsets:\nAs an old adage goes:\nTo control an onion, all you have to do is to control its peels.\nwe mathematically express , where are the peels, and formulate strategies to control .\nNow for each set , say we have a point with either , or with , then by taking , and assuming , we in fact have . For a proof, note that for any , the volume bounds on shows that cannot contain for large enough , while we have:\nThe following diagram might be useful for navigating the definitions and symbols (coutesy to draw.io)\nIn optimization, we are also interested in the question of the speed of convergence. By using the same idea for estimation, we see that it depends on . In ellipsoid methods - as one can guess it - these are given by manipulations with ellipsoids; in center of gravity methods, these are given by other means.\n1.4. Using Ellipsoids and Subgradients It is now (finally 😅) the time to introduce the ellipsoid algorithm. The steps are as follows:\nInitiallize: Ellipsoid , , , Halving: If , call separation oracle for a nonzero direction , so that Else call subgradient oracle for a direction . If , optimality condition reached, terminate. Otherwise continue. Update: Update via the explicit formulas in the next section, to have the properties: and update: to be the new center of this ellipsoid. the argmin of if ; else set to . . . Note that the sets and points then satisfies the settings we previously introduced that will lead to convergence. With a bit of algebra, one has the following:\nEllipsoid Method: Feasibility and Convergence\nFor , we have , with:\nA bit of interpretation on this result, which would illustrate some cool characteristics of this algorithm:\nThe analytical complexity (that is, the number of calls to the oracles needed) to guarantee an accuracy to is , from a black-box optimization perspective. In such sense, it is a dimension-dependent algorithm - as dimension grows, the calls needed grows. As one can see later, the cost update are just some matrix-vector multiplications, as opposed to center-of-gravity which although have a better analytical complexity (of ), but each time step requires the computation of a nontrivial integral, in which in the most easy cases exact solvers still needs exponential computation time. 2. Ellipsoidal Shenanigans Now let us look at some technical tools and results that allow us to work with ellipsoids, tying together the lose ends introduced in the algorithm above.\nIt is just a brief note on how the math is done, leaving out much of the book-keeping and formula derivations. For even more casual readers, you have already understand what ellipsoid method does🎉!\n2.1. Representation of an Ellipsoid An ellipsoid is an affine image of . It can be represented as:\nwhere is SPD (symmetric positive definite) (assuming it having positive volume), admitting a decomposition ; such then describes as , hence an ellipsoid.\n2.2. \u0026ldquo;Ellipsoiding\u0026rdquo; Halved Ellipsoids Here is a fun problem in geometry:\nQuestion\nGiven an ellipsoid with positive volume , a direction , how small an ellipsoid (in terms of volume) can we find so that it encloses the halved ellipsoid ?\nThe case is trivial, so we assume .\nIt would be illustrative to work out the case where , and , then map it back using . We want and lie in , so we define:\nwith ; note that , for . By this requirement, we formulate the optimization problem:\nAfter expressing via , we have by calculus that the optimal point is with value:\nAfter taking account the rescaling of and the remapping of points , we get:\nEllipsoid Update Formula\nFor , we get:\nwhere:\rBubeck, Sébastien. \u0026ldquo;Convex optimization: Algorithms and complexity.\u0026rdquo; Foundations and Trends® in Machine Learning 8.3-4 (2015): 231-357.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"2024-11-21","id":9,"permalink":"/math_notes/cvx_optimization/ellipse/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn this article, I will give a brief guide on what the \u003cem\u003eellipsoid method\u003c/em\u003e is.

Setting the Stage 1.1. First Comparison with the Ellipsoid Algorithm A high level description of the ellipsoid algorithm is that total control of a part of the feasibility region - the \u0026ldquo;onion peels\u0026rdquo; - are gained within each iteration via slicing along suitable directions (either it being a direction for a separating hyperplanes, or a direction given by subgradients), and by volume and shrinking arguments, as the uncontrolled feasibility region shrinks, the optimal value on regions on the peels, would not be too far from that from the uncontrolled region.\nThe \u0026ldquo;ellipsoidal\u0026rdquo; parts comes in the part where we want to gain control to a next peel, which uses ellipsoids as proxies. In center of gravity method, as one can guess it - we use center of gravities.\n1.2. The Algorithm Let us use again to denote the \u0026ldquo;peel\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;remaining onion\u0026rdquo; at time .\nInitiallize: , , to be any point in .\nHalving:\nCall COG oracle (here we think of it as a zeroth order oracle) to obtain the COG: Call subgradient oracle obtain . If , optimality condition reached, terminate. Otherwise continue.\nUpdate:\n; which has the property: the argmin of . One has the following:\nCOG Method: Convergence\nWe have the following bound:\nSome remarks:\nThe step \u0026ldquo;Compute center of gravity\u0026rdquo; is a highly nontrivial step in general if one wants exact solutions (e.g., think of the problem of computing the COG of a simplex with vertices). In such sense, this algorithm is more of theoretical importance then of practical use. The volume inequality during the passage from to will be shown below - it is related to the so-called Grünbaum Inequality, which can be proved by also another famous inequality called Brunn-Minkowski Inequality. The analytical complexity to guarantee an accuracy of is . Compared to ellipsoid method\u0026rsquo;s , both having linear rate of convergence, it is less sensitive to the underlying dimension . 2. Math Behind the COG Method The heart of the COG method lies within Brunn-Minkowski\u0026rsquo;s inequality and Grünbaum\u0026rsquo;s inequality. The latter inequality ensures that the peel we gain control of in each step of the COG method is large enough, while the first is an inequality relating two convex sets with their convex combination.\nFor the casual readers, you have already understand what the COG method does🎉!\nFor the more serious folks here, let us now dive into the beautiful maths.\n2.1. Additional Notations We introduce the following notations:\nGiven and , we write: which is just a dirty notation for constructing cones, convex combinations. Some times we do not distinguish between elements and one-point sets. We write , the volume of the unit ball (in ) Given a measurable subset , we write , which satisfies: Given with , we define as the set of elements with . We define analogously. Given , , we can consider the slice: 2.2. Brunn-Minkowski Inequality A good reference would be this one by R. J. Gardner\u0026rsquo;s review3. The Brunn-Minkowski inequality in the case of convex bodies can be stated concisely as follows4:\nBrunn-Minkowski Inequality\nFixed convex bodies .\nAdditive. The function is concave on . Multiplicative. The function is log-concave on . We will show Item 1. Item 2 follows from Item 15, by the fact that and differ by a constant, and that , are concave on places we are interested. To show Item 1, it suffices to show the following:\nBy definition of Lebesgue measures, it suffices to show the case where are finite union of sets of the form (boxes). Write as the least number of boxes needed to write as union of boxes, and assume . We prove by induction on :\nBase Case. If , may assume , , giving: by applying AM-GM to the terms. Inductive Step. By permuting and realignment, may assume , have positive measures, with both being smaller than , and that: which concludes the proof: Aside\nAnother common way to prove it is to first use Prékopa–Leindler\u0026rsquo;s inequality (specialized to characteristic functions) to establish the multiplicative version, then derive the additive version. The interested readers can consult this lecture note.\n2.3. Grünbaum Inequality I highly recommend checking out this lecture note from this course by Lap Chi Lau.\nGrünbaum Inequality\nGiven convex body with COG at , we have .\nThe proof is a series of clever reductions to simpler cases. It would be beneficial to give definitions to these cases. Given a nonnegative function with support a closed interval containing , we can define a solid of revolution, given by:\nNote that is convex iff is concave. We will see that this is the entry point of Brunn-Minkowski\u0026rsquo;s inequality in the proof of this theorem.\n2.3.1. Special Case: Cone We show the inequality in the case of cones - that is, in the case where with and with being linear. May assume . We get by the following equation utilizing the condition that the COG of is :\nwhich gives:\n2.3.2. Special Case: Convex Solids of Revolution Now we show the inequality in the case of solids of revolution. Suppose the convex body has the form , then is concave, say with support . Associate to a function , with the following properties:\nwith containing is non-negative, linear on , , then by concavity of and these conditions, one can show that:\ndominates on . dominates on . Therefore, the COG of is non-positive, so the special case for cones gives:\n2.3.3. General Case: Reduction to Solids of Revolution For a general convex body , consider the function , given by: By Brunn-Minkowski, it is a compactly-supported concave non-negative function, so by the identity , we are done by considering the solid of revolution 6:\nBubeck, Sébastien. \u0026ldquo;Convex optimization: Algorithms and complexity.\u0026rdquo; Foundations and Trends® in Machine Learning 8.3-4 (2015): 231-357.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nEllipsoid Method, on this site.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nGardner, Richard. \u0026ldquo;The Brunn-Minkowski Inequality.\u0026rdquo; Bulletin of the American mathematical society 39.3 (2002): 355-405.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nFor generalists, we remind that this theorem holds in much general settings.

Bartley.\nThe following is a screenshot of the report, illustrating the key ideas.\nThe Idea We wanted to use the basic collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm to build a book recommender system, from the famous BookCrossing Dataset originally collected by Cai-Nicolas Ziegler, and evaluate performance via n-fold cross-validated MAE, MSE.\nThe problem is that the size of the dataset as well as the sparsity of the user-item matrix makes direct application of the CF algorithm to this dataset a less ideal choice. This project is an exploration of ways to scale CF to BookCrossing.\nOur idea is a type of dimensionality reduction technique, using content-based filtering (CBF), with external data injected into BookCrossing. We did the following to get a reduced user-item matrix:\nClick to Expand\rWe first injected infos - including genre, summary - from a GoodReads dataset hosted on the UCSD RecSys Repo to BookCrossing. To reduce books, we did clustering. The steps are as follows: Vectorize book data (using the basic tfidfvectorizer) Generate a K-regular graph (for some chosen K) with nodes the books, neighbors the top K similar books given by cosine similarity on these vectors (using NearestNeighbors) Run Louvain community detection (using louvain_communities) to generated book clusters. To reduce users, we did stratified subsampling. The steps are as follows: We bin users into different age groups if given - this information is present in the BookCrossing dataset. Inside each bin, we use the same clustering process (community detection on KNN graphs on vector representations) for users, where the vectors are defined as vector of genre counts, an info derived from the GoodReads dataset. For each cluster in each bin, we choose a sampling rate according to a heuristic we defined. We then derive the new user-item matrix via these subsampled users and clustered books.

Afterwards, I grew up in Taiwan, went through education and mandatory millitary training, and came to the States after I completed my B.S. and M.S. degree in math3, pursuing a M.S. degree in Analytics and Georgia Institute of Technology from Aug. 2023, ultimately graduating in Dec. 2024.\nI was once a math person, wanted to have a career in academia, doing algebraic geometry (mostly in moduli spaces). After years of self-isolation and struggle, my views and interests gradually changed, and I finally made up my mind to make the transition to applied math.\nMy Goals Currently I am in the process of job / internship search. After graduation, I realized that there are so many kinds of jobs in the \u0026ldquo;data field\u0026rdquo; - business intelligence, business analytics, data management, data analytics, data engineering, data scientist, machine learning engineer, statistical programmer, statistical analyst, research roles, data architect, \u0026hellip; so I am still learning new tools, relevant technologies, related theories during the mean time, as well as building projects demonstrating data-related skills.\nThe short-term goal is to obtain work experience, know as much thing in different areas of the data field, and get good at least in data analytics. As for mid-term goal (say 5-10 years), I am still open to all kinds of possibilities - whether it being a transition to a data scientist role, or even doing a PhD in optimization.\nHowever, I would envision an ideal life to be something like4:\ndivided among waking hours (~16hrs), where \u0026ldquo;Relationships\u0026rdquo; entails families, friends, business relationships.\nMy Interests Anime. The CGDCT, SOL, or Iyashikei genre are my cups of tea. You can also find me on MyAnimeList. Some of my favorites among these genres would be things like: K-on, Bocchi the Rock, Aria, Mitsuboshi Colors, Ichigo Mashimaro, Gal to Kyouryuu, Azumanga Daioh, Joshiraku, Kitaku-bu Katsudou Kiroku, Yuru Yuri, Nichijou. Some more \u0026ldquo;serious\u0026rdquo; ones would include Yagate Kimi ni Naru, Sakurada Reset, Haibane Renmei, Mawaru Penguindrum, Dungeon Meshi. Music. I listen to anime bgms, op/ed, and used to make some 8bit covers of it using FamiTracker - it\u0026rsquo;s a hobby that I no longer have much time doing it though, although I might pick it up again in the future. When I drive, I mostly listen to worship songs (a lot of them being songs by New Heart Ministries) for road-rage prevention. I used to spent a lot of time listening progressive metal, jazz (mostly Bill Evans, Red Garland, McCoy Tyner, Art Tatum, Oscar Peterson, Bud Powell), as well as psychedelic rock. Tech. I am interested in Linux - currently daily driving with EndeavorOS - as well as frontend development using React. I am also interested in maths related to machine learning / optimization, and typesetting things with , refactoring proofs are also some nerdy hobbies of mine. My Belief I grew up in a Christian family, but went through years of wandering and searching for meaning, as well as going through stages of existential-crisis.\nIt is through the help and guidance of other good brothers and sisters, as well as events that reshaped my view of life, I finally went back to the realization that nothing - including career, interests, relationships - surpasses the importance of a meaningful relationship with God and knowledge in Him, and such is the true root of joy and sense of fullfillment.\nTo end this informal introduction, I would like to share a Scripture that resonated within me recently as I reflected upon my past life:\nPsalms 16:11; NIV + CUVMPT\n11 You make known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.\n11 你必將生命的道路指示我，在你面前有滿足的喜樂，在你右手中有永遠的福樂。\nCongratulations! You just encountered a sensitive topic! Whether Taiwan is by definition a country or not is in some cases an argument-inducing topic (especially among our Mandarin-speaking folks), which is something I would avoid talking about in formal or professional settings; However, I feel like in most cases, this is a fun topic to joke around about.

Roughly speaking, the original topic has the following settings and the corresponding questions posed:\nSettings\nConsider a population of size 31, and a flu going on in this population. The flu has some properties:\nDay 0, the number of sick students if 1 An infected person has a probability p=0.02 infecting any healthy person An infected person will remain infected for precisely 3 days This flu doesn\u0026rsquo;t kill people Problem\nCalculate the distribution and expected number of number of people infected at day 1, 2 Simulate and find an approximation of the distribution of end-date of flu My idea was then to write a Python class (and eventually it became a Python package, though no people use it) that has the following functions:\nSupports calculations of exact statistics Supports simulations for approximation of statistics Supports basic visualizations of the fluspread process My Works I first formulated a more general version of this problem (where population size, infecting probabilities can be tweaked) mathematically, and designed pseudocodes for exact solvers, simulations for statistics (such as {distributions / expectations / variance} of {number of infected people / end dates}).\nThe related theory I used for designing the exact solver was that of Markov chain1, where some of the statistics can be done via such general methods - for example, expectations, variance of end dates are analyzed via first step analysis techniques.\nSome Screenshots Package\rReport\rFragments of final report (page 1, 5, 8, 11) Final Thoughts It was pretty cool seeing the things I derived with the theory of Markov chains matching the simulation results, a type of \u0026ldquo;mathematical joy\u0026rdquo; I would say.\nBack to Projects Page\rBack to Resume\rThis was a fun problem to work with from a mathematical viewpoint, but it was later that I learned that such model is a type of SI model (without the \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo;).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"2024-12-01","id":14,"permalink":"/about/projects/flusim/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003csvg\n  xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n  width=\"24\"\n  height=\"24\"\n  viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n  fill=\"none\"\n  stroke=\"currentColor\"\n  stroke-width=\"2\"\n  stroke-linecap=\"round\"\n  stroke-linejoin=\"round\"\n \n class=\"outline/brand-github svg-inline\" id=\"svg-brand-github\" role=\"img\"\u003e\n  \u003cpath stroke=\"none\" d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"none\"/\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M9 19c-4.3 1.4 -4.3 -2.5 -6 -3m12 5v-3.5c0 -1 .1 -1.4 -.5 -2c2.8 -.3 5.5 -1.4 5.5 -6a4.6 4.6 0 0 0 -1.3 -3.2a4.2 4.2 0 0 0 -.1 -3.2s-1.1 -.3 -3.5 1.3a12.3 12.3 0 0 0 -6.2 0c-2.4 -1.6 -3.5 -1.3 -3.5 -1.3a4.2 4.2 0 0 0 -.1 3.2a4.6 4.6 0 0 0 -1.3 3.2c0 4.6 2.7 5.7 5.5 6c-.6 .6 -.6 1.2 -.5 2v3.5\" /\u003e\n\u003c/svg\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/ZebraAlgebra/flusim\"\u003eGithub Link\u003c/a\u003e \u003csvg\n  xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n  width=\"24\"\n  height=\"24\"\n  viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n  fill=\"none\"\n  stroke=\"currentColor\"\n  stroke-width=\"2\"\n  stroke-linecap=\"round\"\n  stroke-linejoin=\"round\"\n \n class=\"outline/file-type-pdf svg-inline\" id=\"svg-file-type-pdf\" role=\"img\"\u003e\n  \u003cpath stroke=\"none\" d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"none\"/\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M14 3v4a1 1 0 0 0 1 1h4\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M5 12v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2 -2h7l5 5v4\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M5 18h1.5a1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0 -3h-1.5v6\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M17 18h2\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M20 15h-3v6\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M11 15v6h1a2 2 0 0 0 2 -2v-2a2 2 0 0 0 -2 -2h-1z\" /\u003e\n\u003c/svg\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/10dRa2x0HmtnD7IlcfjxcTbAtfH_nD8Qa/view?usp=sharing\"\u003eReport Document\u003c/a\u003e \u003csvg\n  xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n  width=\"24\"\n  height=\"24\"\n  viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n  fill=\"none\"\n  stroke=\"currentColor\"\n  stroke-width=\"2\"\n  stroke-linecap=\"round\"\n  stroke-linejoin=\"round\"\n \n class=\"outline/brand-python svg-inline\" id=\"svg-brand-python\" role=\"img\"\u003e\n  \u003cpath stroke=\"none\" d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"none\"/\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M12 9h-7a2 2 0 0 0 -2 2v4a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h3\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M12 15h7a2 2 0 0 0 2 -2v-4a2 2 0 0 0 -2 -2h-3\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M8 9v-4a2 2 0 0 1 2 -2h4a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v5a2 2 0 0 1 -2 2h-4a2 2 0 0 0 -2 2v5a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h4a2 2 0 0 0 2 -2v-4\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M11 6l0 .01\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M13 18l0 .01\" /\u003e\n\u003c/svg\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://test.pypi.org/project/flusim/\"\u003ePython package on TestPyPI\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"flusim"},{"content":"\rLast updated on 2025-01-09\nThis is a \u0026ldquo;Now\u0026rdquo; Page.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m Learning Math: Convex Optimization Visualization Tools: Visx, PowerBI, Looker What I\u0026rsquo;m Reading Daily Devotional.
