Computing for Data Analysis iCDA CSE6040\nDEW: 3/9/5 Format: HW: Weekly basis. All Jupyter notebooks. Exams: 3 exams. Open book, but no Github Copilot, posting exam questions on forums, or interacting with other people. Similar to homeworks and practice problems. Projects: One optional project. I didn\u0026rsquo;t do it and it became a regret of mine. Content: Basics of data wrangling and numerical computation in Python (data structures, Numpy, Scipy sparse matrices, Pandas) Basics of SQL (SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, GROUPBY\u0026hellip; clauses). Several basic demos of ML algorithms (regression, K-means, PCA). Tips: Do HW as soon as possible. More difficult to complete hw under time pressure for coding HWs. Do practice questions before exam. 2. Introduction to Analytics Modeling iAM ISYE6501\nDEW: 5/8/6 Format: HW: Weekly basis. All R markdowns, with a few exceptions: For linear programming, Python\u0026rsquo;s PuLP is needed. For discrete event simulation, either Arena or Python\u0026rsquo;s SimPy are needed. Exams: 3 exams. Project: 1 project, details released near the end of semester. Content: Learning how to use some ML models in R on data, assess model quality, as well as teaching some basic data science ideas. Tips: Get used to R and R markdown notebooks, as well as figuring out a suitable workflow, since students have to generate a report file every week. 3. Simulation Sim ISYE6644\nDEW: 4/8/4 Difficulty: 3.5 out of 10.0 Enjoyment: 8.0 out of 10.0 Format: HW: Weekly basis. Multiple choice questions on Canvas. Exams: 3 exams. Allows cheat sheets. Project: 1 project. One can either work on topics supplied by the teaching team, or come up with one. Content: Probabilities, statistics bootcamps. The Arena software, Theories for simulating random number generators and stochastic processes. Tips: Read Prof. Goldsman\u0026rsquo;s book on probabilities and stats. The tip for having a good score on exams is to compile good cheat sheets. Misc.: Prof. Goldsman\u0026rsquo;s lecture videos has some funny jokes. 4. Business Fundamentals in Analytics BFA MGT8803\nDEW: 9/4/3 Format: HW: 2 small ones that accounts for 10% of total grade. Exams: 5 exams for each 5 modules (see below). Allows the use of excel. No cheat sheets. Project: None. Content: 5 modules Financial Accounting Finance Supply Chain Business Strategy Marketing Tips: The first two modules are extremely packed with info. For people without background related to these fields, all the concepts in these modules can take a fiar while to be digested. Tips for studying for the first two exams Do the self assessment questions repeatedly Get used to the Excel workflow for doing the accounting, finance calculations Check for study cards online, some OMSA alumnis prepared them, e.g. this one on quizlet. Misc.: As mentioned above, the first two modules are no-joke - I pulled three all-nighters at the library just to study for these 2 exams. Many people in the OMSA slack channel recommended taking this class during the summer, as one can drop one modules for the final grade calculations. 5. Computational Data Analytics CDA ISYE6740\nDEW: 7/9/7 Format: This course is basically Machine Learning I. It has mathy parts in it (writing proofs, do hand calculations, implement algorithms, report and explain findings). There are 6 homeworks and 1 final project, no exams. For the final project, our team also worked on a book recommendation system built upon the famous Bookcrossing dataset, using the traditional user-based collaborative filtering (UBCF). The bottleneck we encountered was that the user-item matrix was too large, so we experimented with different interesting approaches to tackle this problem. Misc.: I enjoyed this course a lot. Lectures are very helpful and clear, and the homeworks are fun to work with. 6. Data Analytics in Business DAB MGT6203\nDEW: 3/5/3 Format: HW: 3 homeworks in R-markdown format, graded by peer. Exams: 2 midterms, several self-assessments. Project: Team proejct. Our team did some analysis on the Kaggle data set UFC Dataset. Tips: Find teams early. The most time will be spent on projects. Misc.: The technical aspects of this course is covered by iAM, albeit even easier. 7. Data and Visual Analytics DVA CSE6242\nDEW: 5/6/9 Format: HW: 4 homeworks, graded by autograders. HW2 is a lot of d3.js. HW3 is to play with GCP, AWS, Databricks, Azure, \u0026hellip; HW4 builds a random forest. Exams: No exams. Project: We build a book recommender app; check out our Github repo. Tips: Study d3 soon. Learn how to make bar charts, line graphs, choropleth maps. Basic knowledge in DOM structure is beneficial and the autograder is very strict about it. Read through the project specifications carefully, don\u0026rsquo;t miss anything as gradings strictly follows it. E.g., all team members has to record an unlisted Youtube video explaining the poster representations, and I mistakenly assumed that only one video per team is required, so I lost 5 pts for it. Misc.: I personally think that the major takeaway of this course is the experience to collab with other students, as well as trying to pick up unknown technologies as fast as possible. Although the course touches upon several different technologies, most of the time time is spent on reading through long homework specifications and fighting against the autograder. 8. Higher Dimensional Data Analytics HDDA ISYE8803\nDEW: 7/10/7 Format: Content: Functional Data Analysis (spline, FPCA) Image Analysis Tensor Data Analysis (Tucker Decomposition, HOSVD) Optimization I (1st+2nd order methods) (Dropped in Summer) Optimization II (Proximal Gradient Descent, ALM+ADMM, Coordinate Descent) (Dropped in Summer) Regularization (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, NNG and Adaptive Lasso, Grouped Lasso) Applications of Regularization (Compressive Sensing, Matrix Completion, RPCA, SSD, RKHS Ridge Kernel Regression) HW and Exams: 2 Exams, 7 Homeworks corresponding to 7 modules (optimization modules dropped in summer). Exams are similar to HWs, but is fun and challenging. Misc.: I absolutely loved this course. Would recommend to anyone in the program that likes math. 9. Network Science NS CS7280\nDEW: 4/5/5 Format: Content: Network models, core network science notions, community detection, dynamic processes on networks. HW and Exams: 5 HWs (Jupyter notebooks with exercises using NetworkX and other related libraries), 14 Quizzes. Misc.: I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like I learned much from the course; concepts are pretty high-level without clear explanations. The textbook they used is the online textbook by Barabasi, but I would personally recommend anyone that is interested in network science to look into the book by Newman. 10. Applied Natural Language Processing ANLP CSE8803\nDEW: 3/6/4 Format: HW: 4 HWs (Jupyter Notebooks with exercises using packages that does text embeddings, or packages in PyTorch, HuggingFace that does NLP things). Quizzes for each module. Misc. The contents are cool, allowing us to toy with some cool NLP tools (such as LSTM, BERT). 11. Applied Analytics Practicum Prac CSE6748\nDEW: 5/8/7 Content: Form a team, and work on a project. Our project is sponsered by MedTransGo, where we analyzed their tech update text logs as well as their transaction records (both of which we transformed into time series), to do trend and seasonality detection, correlation analysis, and visualizations. Format: Deliverables includes Midterm Slidedecks and Final Reports. One also has to watch course videos, accounting for 20% of the grade. For the course videos, the check marks might not indicate a full completion score - jumping within videos will result in point deductions. Misc.: It was in this project that I discovered the crazy power of PowerBI, when I witnessed my teammate using it. 12. Classes I might Take After I Graduate DL (Deep Learning), DO (Deterministic Optimization).\n","date":"2024-11-29","id":1,"permalink":"/blog/omsa-course-review/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI enrolled in Georgia Tech\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003eOnline Masters in Analytics\u003c/em\u003e program as a fulltime student, starting from 2023 Fall, graduated in 2024 Fall.

A good reference would be the note by Sébastien Bubeck 1.\nI will first give a high-level breakdown on why this algorithm works, then briefly write about how mathematically the ellipsoids are manipulated. Another optimization algorithm that is seldomly used in practice, but conceptually closely-related is the center of gravity method. This will be explained in another article.\n1. Setting the Stage 1.1. Assumptions and Notations Optimization Problem. Minimize a convex function defined over a convex body .\nGeneral results on convex analysis guarantees that attains minimum on some ; let us also write the optimal value as .\nAssumptions. For , we make the assumptions:\nValue Bound. for some . Volume Bound. for some , ; here is the open ball centered at with radius . Available Oracles. We assume the following 0th and 1st-order oracles available to us:\nSeparation Oracle. Given , we can ask for a direction with , where is the half space . Subgradient Oracle. Given , we can ask for a direction . 1.2. Utilizing Volume and Value Bounds via Shrinking Intuitively, points close to shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too bad. Although we do not know , it still makes sense to consider the following construction: Given , define the set (which can be thought of shrinking towards ):\nOn this set, we have the function bounds and volume bounds on :\nby utilizing our assumptions on convexity, volume and value bounds. In this sense, we have the following general idea:\nIf we are able to solve for an optimal point in a major portion of the feasibility region, this point would in fact be close to the true optimal solution.\nWe formalize this idea and give an abstract proof of why the ellipsoid method works.\n1.3. General Proof of Convergence The ellipsoid method is an iterative method. In each step, it gains total control of a part of the feasibility region, by using ellipsoids as a proxy, through halving along subgradients or separating hyperplanes.\nSuppose at time , the remaining uncontrolled region is written as . This gives us a descending sequence of subsets:\nAs an old adage goes:\nTo control an onion, all you have to do is to control its peels.\nwe mathematically express , where are the peels, and formulate strategies to control .\nNow for each set , say we have a point with either , or with , then by taking , and assuming , we in fact have . For a proof, note that for any , the volume bounds on shows that cannot contain for large enough , while we have:\nThe following diagram might be useful for navigating the definitions and symbols (coutesy to draw.io)\nIn optimization, we are also interested in the question of the speed of convergence. By using the same idea for estimation, we see that it depends on . In ellipsoid methods - as one can guess it - these are given by manipulations with ellipsoids; in center of gravity methods, these are given by other means.\n1.4. Using Ellipsoids and Subgradients It is now (finally 😅) the time to introduce the ellipsoid algorithm. The steps are as follows:\nInitiallize: Ellipsoid , , , Halving: If , call separation oracle for a nonzero direction , so that Else call subgradient oracle for a direction . If , optimality condition reached, terminate. Otherwise continue. Update: Update via the explicit formulas in the next section, to have the properties: and update: to be the new center of this ellipsoid. the argmin of if ; else continue. . . Note that the sets and points then satisfies the settings we previously introduced that will lead to convergence. With a bit of algebra, one has the following:\nEllipsoid Method: Feasibility and Convergence\nFor , we have , with:\nA bit of interpretation on this result, which would illustrate some cool characteristics of this algorithm:\nThe analytical complexity (that is, the number of calls to the oracles needed) to guarantee an accuracy to is , from a black-box optimization perspective. In such sense, it is a dimension-dependent algorithm - as dimension grows, the calls needed grows. As one can see later, the cost update are just some matrix-vector multiplications, as opposed to center-of-gravity which although have a better analytical complexity (of ), but each time step requires the computation of a nontrivial integral, in which in the most easy cases exact solvers still needs exponential computation time. 2. Ellipsoidal Shenanigans Now let us look at some technical tools and results that allow us to work with ellipsoids, tying together the lose ends introduced in the algorithm above.\nIt is just a brief note on how the math is done, leaving out much of the book-keeping and formula derivations. For even more casual readers, you have already understand what ellipsoid method does🎉!\n2.1. Representation of an Ellipsoid An ellipsoid is an affine image of . It can be represented as:\nwhere is SPD (symmetric positive definite) (assuming it having positive volume), admitting a decomposition ; such then describes as , hence an ellipsoid.\n2.2. \u0026ldquo;Ellipsoiding\u0026rdquo; Halved Ellipsoids Here is a fun problem in geometry:\nQuestion\nGiven an ellipsoid with positive volume , a direction , how small an ellipsoid (in terms of volume) can we find so that it encloses the halved ellipsoid ?\nThe case is trivial, so we assume .\nIt would be illustrative to work out the case where , and , then map it back using . We want and lie in , so we define:\nwith ; note that , for .
