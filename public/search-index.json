To have things to put on LinkedIn, as a way to jot down some thoughts and discoveries, as an alternative way for writing down some optimization-related math notes, and most importantly - it is an interesting thing to do.\nHow is this site generated? The Short answer This site is built using Hugo, with theme Doks, built on top of Thulite, hosted on Netlify.\nThe Not-so-short answer This static site is built using the static site generator (SSG) Hugo, which is Go-based. SSG is a convenient tool for generating nice webpages from Markdown files supplied by the user. The theme used in this site (which can be roughly understood as a set of pre-built configurations and clever customizations) is called Doks. Doks is also built on top of the web framework Thulite, powered by Hugo and npm. This site is hosted on Netlify, which provides services for hosting sites; for small sites, no fee is needed. How to setup a Hugo Site? Install Go and Hugo. Browse the themes gallery, find one that you like the most and clone that into your machine. Add contents and customize! That\u0026rsquo;s basically it!\n","date":"2024-11-18","id":2,"permalink":"/blog/hello-personal-page/","summary":"First post on Hugo Blog!","tags":["Hugo"],"title":"Hello Personal Page!"},{"content":"\r","date":"2023-09-07","id":3,"permalink":"/blog/","summary":"Sharing thoughts and discoveries.","tags":[],"title":"Blog Posts"},{"content":"A PDF version can be found here.\nContact Infos \u0026amp; Socials Phone ~ 713-319-5876 Email ~ swang3068 at gatech dot edu\rLinkedIn ~ swang3068 Github ~ ZebraAlgebra Personal Website MyAnimeList ~ CabbageCat Education Start End School Degree Location 2016/08 2020/05 National Taiwan University B.S. in Math Taipei, Taiwan 2022/02 2023/05 National Taiwan University M.S. in Math Taipei, Taiwan 2023/08 2024/12 Georgia Inst. of Technology M.S. in Analytics Atlanta, GA, U.S.A.
